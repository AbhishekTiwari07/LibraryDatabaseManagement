## About

Project has **CRUD** operations for the basic flow of management system.
It also handles the complex calls for organising and maintaining the issue and return, books' count.
An admin is assinged to meet all the requests from the users regarding any query.
A certain time is fixed for the usage of a book for each user and further it has authentication system for both the admin and a user.
So the project was all about the implementation of learnt skills and scaling the complex systems to a smaller complex version.
